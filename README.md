Experimented with ChatGPT to see how much of the project I could get done by prompt engineering.
The only issue that I faced were that ChatGPT was slightly unfamiliar with MATLAB syntax as it tried to use \ as an escape character when it is ' in MATLAB.
Other than that, the project is incredibly accurate as ChatGPT successfully programmed the logic for the code and was able to create a GitHub website to display the project.
